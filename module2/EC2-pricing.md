# EC2 Billing Options

## On-Demand
only pay for the duration that your instance runs
can be per hour or second depending on the instance type and OS you choose

ideal for short-term, irregular workloads that cannot be interrupted. No upfront costs or minimum contracts apply. The instances run continuously until you stop them, and you pay for only the compute time you use.
