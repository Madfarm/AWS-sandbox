Flexible and faster than on-premises servers to set up

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud as Amazon EC2 instances. 



only pay for what you use -  only pay for instances that are running

> Multitenancy - sharing underlying hardware between virtual machines

EC2 instances, tho they are sharing resources, are not aware of the other virtual machines they are sharing resrouces with

Can be Linux or Windows
are configurable

- resizable, called vertical scaling

you also control the networking aspect of an EC2 instance such as the type of requests make it to the server


## How EC2 Works
First you must launch an instance
There are templates for basic configurations like what operating system

you can also select the instance types
