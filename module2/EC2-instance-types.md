Each EC2 instance type is grouped under an instance family and are optimized for certain tasks



types offer different cpu, storage, memory, and networking capacity

## Instance Families
- General Purpose
- Compute Optimized
- Memory Optimized
- Accelerated computing
- Storage Optimized


> General Purpose
Balanced resources do lots of stuff


> Compute Optimized
Computer intensive tasks like gaming servers, high performance computing, and scientific modeling

> Memory Optimized
self explanatory

> Accelerated computing
utilizes hardware accelerators
- floating point number calculation
- graphics processing
- data pattern matching

> Storage Optimized
- High performance for locally stored data
